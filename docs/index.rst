AgriSatPy
=========
AgriSatPy is a lightweight package to organize, explore and process satellite remote sensing data. The development was motivated by the frustration that there are no end-to-end workflows that manage (Sentinel-2) **satellite data** and convert it into formats with which the image data can be used for further **data-driven analysis** with (geo)pandas.

Our focus lies on Sentinel-2 MSI for which we offer special support but other satellite platforms in the optical domain could be added in the future as well.

Because of our background in agronomy and geography, we developed the tools to efficiently answer our research questions. However, we are convinced that the present package can also be useful to other researchers who need to work with satellite data or want to get familiar with the world of remote sensing.
