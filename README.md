# AgriSatPy - Agricultural Satellite Data in Python

AgriSatPy is a lightweight package to organize, explore and process satellite remote sensing data. The development was motivated by the frustration that there are no end-to-end workflows that manage (Sentinel-2) **satellite data** and convert it into formats with which the image data can be used for further **data-driven analysis** with (geo)pandas.

Our focus lies on Sentinel-2 MSI for which we offer special support but other satellite platforms in the optical domain should work as well.

Because of our background in agronomy and geography, we developed the tools to efficiently answer our research questions. However, we are convinced that the present package can also be useful to other researchers who want or need to work with satellite data.
